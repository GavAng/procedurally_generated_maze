# procedurally_generated_maze

A script that generates mazes into your code editor's output.

I find sitting and pressing the run button a lot cooler than the maze game version of this project.

The code is slightly better than the maze game, it is more readable and has more efficient functions, but there is still a lot to be improved on.
